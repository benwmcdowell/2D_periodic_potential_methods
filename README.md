# plot_Mathieu_eigenenergies
Calculates and plots the characteristic values of the Mathieu equation for a range of user specified barrier heights, spatial frequencies, and solution orders.
For a specified barrier height, calculates the real space projection of the probability density for Mathieu eigenfunctions.
